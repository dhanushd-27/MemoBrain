## **Authentication**

Memobrain uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication. The system follows a two-token authentication process:

- **Access Token**: A short-lived token used for authenticating API requests. It is sent with each request and expires after a specified period (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to obtain a new access token once the current access token expires. Refresh tokens are stored securely and are used to maintain a seamless login experience.
